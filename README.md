This is the entire source code/images etc... of a website which holds my portfolio and random projects.
I hope this comes in useful for someone that wants to know how a certain thing was implemented on
the website or may want to copy paste any part of the code feel free to. Main coding languages used
HTML, CSS & JavaScript. And by the way for those who wanna do something similar, I used ai to help me when I didn't know how to do what I wanted, eventually, I did it enough that I knew how to do it myself. We all have teachers. ðŸ˜‚
